## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Lists

Oh, Yes! You heard me right the first time I am going to add lists.

- First Item  
- Second Item. Please notice to leave two spaces at the end of each list item.  
- This is the third *item* on the list. So we have *italics* and **bold** points to make, as well as [links to talk about](www.google.com).  

Now I wonder how to make text that is npth italicized and bold. But I shall leave that for another day.
